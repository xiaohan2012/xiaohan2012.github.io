<div class="lead pretty-links">
I currently work as a Data Scientist at Unity Technologies. 

Before that, I was a postdoc researcher at Aalto University in Finland between 2021 and 2022, working on interpretable machine learning.

I obtained my PhD degree from Aalto University in 2020 autumn. My supervisor was [Aris Gionis](https://www.kth.se/profile/argioni).
We worked on approximation algorithms with their applications in epidemics, online polarization, and fairness ([thesis link](https://aaltodoc.aalto.fi/handle/123456789/46243))

I did my master study at University of Helsinki (2013 - 2016) and my bachelor study at Wuhan University of Technology, China (2008 - 2012).
