My name is Han Xiao. I am a data scientist at [Cambri](https://www.cambri.io/). Before that, I was at [Upright](https://www.uprightproject.com/) and [Unity Ads](https://unity.com/products/unity-ads).

In addition, I was a postdoc researcher at Aalto University in Finland between 2021 and 2022, working on interpretable machine learning.

I obtained my PhD degree from Aalto University in 2020 autumn. My supervisor was [Aris Gionis](https://www.kth.se/profile/argioni).
We worked on approximation algorithms with their applications in misinformation, online polarization, and fairness ([thesis link](https://aaltodoc.aalto.fi/handle/123456789/46243))

I did my master study at University of Helsinki (2013 - 2016) and my bachelor study at Wuhan University of Technology, China (2008 - 2012).
