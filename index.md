My name is Han Xiao. 

My expertise lies in the design and development of algorithms that address real-world problems. I obtained my PhD degree with a focus on algorithm research in optimization and data science. Since 2016, I have maintained a consistent record of publications in top computer science venues. My research topics cover discrete optimization, approximation algorithms, and sampling combinatorial structures.

I have been coding since 2008, primarily using Python and C++. Not merely a skill, coding has become an enjoyable part of my life. I am proficient in making a computer program run fast, e.g., via SIMD and multi-core parallelism. Moreover, I am an endorser and practitioner of test-driven development.

I excel at presenting technical works to general audiences, delivering presentations that are typically concise, focused, and illustrative.

I have a keen interest in the green transition and have been actively expanding my knowledge base on related topics. Above all, I aspire to create positive changes for our planet and societies.

Currently, I am working on machine learning and recommender system at Unity Technologies, Finland. Prior to this, I was a post-doctoral researcher at Aalto University in 2021, following the completion of my PhD degree from Aalto in 2020.
