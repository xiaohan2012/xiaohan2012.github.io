My name is Han Xiao. I enjoy working on algorithm and data science in general. 

I currently work as a Data Scientist at Unity Technologies. Before that, I was a postdoc researcher at Aalto University in Finland between 2021 and 2022, working on interpretable machine learning.

I obtained my PhD degree from Aalto University in 2020 autumn. My supervisor was [Aris Gionis](https://www.kth.se/profile/argioni).
We worked on approximation algorithms with their applications in epidemics, online polarization, and fairness ([thesis link](https://aaltodoc.aalto.fi/handle/123456789/46243))

I obtained my master degree from University of Helsinki in 2016. My undergraduate study was done at Wuhan University of Technology, China.
