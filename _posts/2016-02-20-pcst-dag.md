Algorithm

1. Find edge e = (i, j) with \\( i \in  C_p \in \mathcal{C}, j=C_q.root , C_q \in \mathcal{C}, C_p \neq C_q \\) that minimizes \\( \epsilon = \frac{c_e - d(j)}{f(C_q)}\\)
2. \\( F = F \cup \{e\} \\)
3. For each \\( C \in \mathcal{C} \\), \\(d(C.root) += \epsilon f(c))
4. the rest are the same with

Justification on the modification:

1. \\( d(i) = \sum\limits{\{C | \text{is a tree(created sometime up till now) } && C.root = i\}} y_C \\): induction(k and k+1 iteration, i is root/no-root before/after)
2. \\( \sum\limits{e \in \sigma(S)} y_S = d(j)\\), where \\( e=(i, j)\\): suppose if there is a tree \\(C\\) such that \\(y_C>0\\) and \\(j\\) is not root in \\(C\\), then the algorithm has formed such a tree before, which is a contradiction because \\(j\\) is a root in the current component.

Approximation gaurantee proof:

- left-hand side = \\( \sum\limits_{S}y_S |F^{'} \cap \sigma(S)| + \sum\limits_{j}\sum\limits_{S \subseteq C_j} y_S\\)
- At each iteraction, left-hand side increases by \\( \epsilon (\sum\limits_{v \in N_a} din_v + |N_d|) = \epsilon (\sum\limits_{v \in N_a - N_d} din_v + |N_d|) = \epsilon (|N_a-N_d| + |N_d|) = \epsilon |N_a|\\)
- At each iteraction, right hand side increases \\(\epsilon |N_a|\\)
- So it's optimal


Problem found:

1. for general DiGraph: an example where the greedy solution yields value(the lower bound) **greater** than optimal primal solution. If LP is right, then the way I calculate the LB is wrong(the algorithm can be wrong).
