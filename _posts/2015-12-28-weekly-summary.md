# Done

- Better meta-graph visualization
- More results
  - without decomposition
  - 25 topics
  - more parameter combinations
- discussion
  - issues with decomposition
  - some observation on the result: many broadcast in meta graph and star shape in original graph
  - thread(multiple replies/comments) as the interaction unit(refused because off-topic)
  - define the links in meta graph in other ways
  - adding weights to interactions nodes
  - extra summarizations on top of the result(off-topic for now)
  - synthetic data


# TODO

- Synthetic data(define some major events and adding noisy links)
- More real dataset test
  - memtracker
  - tumbler
- PCST for DAG(prove NP-hardness)
- Encourage other types of interactions by adding weight, for example, adding importance to "forward" type
- Run minimum spanning tree instead of Dijkstra
- Fix the bug in the decomposed graph
- Better visualization of the event    
- Search texts on link prediction to model the interaction link score

The summary should be done immediately after the dicussion...
