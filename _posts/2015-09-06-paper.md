## Motivation

Existing approach:

- NMF directly on the implicit feedback matrix to get the representation for users and items
- global recommendation model for all users


Novelty here:

- **User preference dillusion**: Use meta-path to derive user-item similarity matrix and apply NMF on each of them to get the latent features
- **personalized recommendation model**: cluster users into differnt groups and for each group, derive group-specific feature weights. For final score, user-cluster similarity is also considered.

## Approach

### User preference dillusion

Define different meta-paths for different semantics. Using movie context for example, we can define the following math-paths:

- `user-movie-tag-movie`: user might be interested another movie with the same tag that is contained by one move he watches
- `user-movie-actor-movie`: user might be interested to another movie by the same actor in one movie he watched before

Using the `PathSim` measure, we can define *user-movie* measure as `\sum\limit_e^' (s(e, e^'))`, where `e \in ` all the movies the user watches. It's simply matrix multiplication.

For `L` meta-paths, we will have `L` user-item matrices. And we apply NMF on each of them to derive the path-specific user/item representaiton.

The final score can be the weighted sum of the individual scores, `\sum\limit_l \theta_l U_i V_j`, where `U_i` and `V_j` are the representation for the `ith` user and `jth` item respectively. However, this is referred to the global model, where `L` weight parameters are shared across all the users.

### Personalized recommendation model

Global model does not distinguish between different users. Users might be interested in the same movie for different reasons.

Users are clustered into `K` groups. The cluster algorithm and user representation is flexible to choose. And there are `KL` weight parameters, `L` for each group. When calculating the final scores, `\sum_k c(i, k)\sum\limit_l \theta_{kl} U_i V_j`, where `c(i, k)` are the similarity between the `ith` user and `kth` group.

### Ranking-based learning

For implicit feedback, it's unreasonable to assume negative label for entry with value 0. 0 is a mixture of "not-interested" and "unwatched". A *weaker* assumption is user is more interested in items with value 1 than those with value 0.

The likelihood is `\prod\limit_{u_i} \prod\limit_{(e_a, e_b)} P(e_a > e_b; u_i | \theta)`.

Adding Gaussian prior, the posterior `P(\theta|R)` is sum of log-likelihood plus L2 regularization.

Stochastic gradient descent can be applied here.


## What I have learned

- Matrix factorization can be used for recommendation problem. Content information as well as network information can be leveraged to fight sparsity.
- Meta path here is used for user preference dillusion
- Ranking-based learning: there should be resources and variants on it
- Clustering is here used as bridge to add personalization(more granularity) while keeping the parameter space relatively modest. 
- Using Gaussian as the prior in the ranking-based optimization lead to L2 optimization
- precision-at-position and top-k mean reciprocal as the evaluation for ranking-based models. 
- Root mean square error as the evaluation for explicit feedback model
- Performance analysis on the user feedback sparsity and item popularity is necessary for deeper understanding
- For collaborative filtering, sparsity is a problem. Possible direction is to leverage external knowledge(network structure, user profile)

## Question / future

- Why matrix factorization is better than other methods for CF problem?
- How NMF is done?
- How content information can be incorporated? Maybe as links between entities
- How to co online recommendation? New user/item is being added.
- Learn from explicit and implicit feedback simultaneously? Rating scores plus watch history
- How to scale it up, e.g,  when there are millions of movies to recommend?
