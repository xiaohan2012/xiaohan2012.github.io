##Announcement

Maui 2.0, a faster keyword extraction tool compared to [Maui][maui], is published under MIT license at [Github][https://github.com/xiaohan2012/maui-2].

Currently, the build script for Maui 2.0 is not present. Feel free to contribute to the repository.

##Highlights

2. 10 times faster than the [original maui][maui].
3. Java API that can be used by Java or Scala program.
