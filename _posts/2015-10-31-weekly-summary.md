# Done

- Gave up on the previous model. Switched to Polina's model.
- Discussed with Aris. Found several problems whose NP-completeness is unknown
- Thought about the problems, provided feedback to Aris' summary

# To-do

- Why Price Collection Steiner Tree(PCST) is our problem?
- If so, read relevant papers on PCST.
- Search paper on the Length-constrained Sum-maximum Subtree(LSS) problems
- Whether LSS and PCST is NP-complete on DAG
- Whether the quadratic-constrained sum-maximum subtree is NP-complete.
