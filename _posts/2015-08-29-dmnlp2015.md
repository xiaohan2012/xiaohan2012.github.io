## Topic modeling & phrase mining

What I learned:

- Three ways to combine phrase mining and topic mining(pre, post and joint).
- First phrase mining and then topic modeling has its justification(words in phrase tend to exhbit the same topic) and `PhraseLDA` is a LDA-variant.
- There are some  ways to **evaluate** topic models, for example: coherence and phrase intrusion.


## Phrase mining

- [Mining Quality Phrases from Massive Text Corpora, 2015](http://research.microsoft.com/apps/pubs/default.aspx?id=241783)

Learned:

- Several aspects to model the quality of phrase: *popularity*(frequency), *concordance*(the words tend to appear together), *informativeness*(they don't appear everywhere), *completeness*(nothing is left nor extra)
- Frequency indicates the `phraseness`. However, raw frequency doesn't tell the whole truth. `cnt("vector machine") >= cnt('support vector machine')`. It should be rectified. One way is to segment the document into phrases and then count.


Questions:

- How to segment the document into phrases?
- How to bootstrap to get the training data for the classifier?
- How to use distant supervision to avoid human labeling?
- Can it be combined with the paper in the following section?


## Entity linking/typing

- [ClusType: Effective Entity Recognition and Typing by Relation Phrase‚ÄêBased Clustering, 2015](http://web.engr.illinois.edu/~xren7/fp611-ren.pdf)

Intuition:

- label propagation on the network where nodes are relation phrase, surface name and mentions
- relation phrase can tell something about the types of surface names
- surface name can tell something about the types of mentions
- mentions can also tell something about the types of other mentions(e.g, with the same surface names)


Three challenges in entity linking/typing:

- mention extraction(chunker is used which cannot adapt to changing/specific domains)
- surface name ambiguity(prev approaches map the same surface names to one entity)
- context sparsity(two entities in the same relation described in different ways)

Solution:

- minimum linguistic knowledge
- model each mention
- clustering the relation phrases to allow more typing information sharing

Learned:

- There is semi-supervised way to perform entity linking/typing!

Questions:

- If the POS tagger is also sensitive to domain(e.g, news and twitter), any better ways to extract entity mention?
- How to model the type inference as a joint optimization problem?

Problems:

- How to use the KB and annotate part of the heterogenous graph to get started? It's a entity linking/typing problem?
- Modeling the typing of phrase relation might be over-simplistic(e.g, passive/active voices, tri-relation)
