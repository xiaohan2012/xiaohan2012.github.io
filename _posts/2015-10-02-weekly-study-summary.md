# Done

1. Finished watching and summary writing of:
   1. Learning in Markov network, several algorithms for several configuration of the network and potential function
   2. EM algorithm. I started to appreciate its generality on probabilistic graphical models)
2. Made the following progress on my thesis topic
   1. Discussed with Aris and narrowed our attention to email network. And we only focus on ego network as it avoids the privacy issue
   2. Found some literatures of the following topics:
      - Anomaly/outlier detection of graphs
	  - Event detection in dynamic graphs
	  - Hierarchical topic mining
	  - Topic evolution
   3. Something we can do for the ego email network:
      - Topic evolution modeling for the user's email even on finer granurity, e.g, different groups
	  - Event detection/classification of incoming email


# Next plan / questions

1. Consider other possible directions.
   - more reading
   - email grouping / tag suggestion / user-user relationship categorization
2. Let's try event detection for now. Before doing it, try to define what an event is?(change of group? change of topic? Some deadline/holiday comes?) Try to think about it from both text/content and graph structure perspective.
3. Try to find interesting topics for ego network(communication strengths of different groups for example)
4. Try to find what aspects a user might be interested for his own email network(an retrospect of what he has been doing for the past months?)
5. Topic evolution is cool. Think about what are they possible solutions for topic modeling is possible.
6. How can email user experience be further improved? What are the desire features a user want?
