# Done

- PCST:
  - read the `2 - 1/n`-approximation algorithm: primal-dual method, linear relaxation
  - Cannot find pseudo code for budgeted version
  - Found some reference to k-mst problem
- Preprocessing Kiran's hashtag-based tweets dataset
- Gathered related work on twitter summarization

# Todo

- Experiment on Kiran's dataset and Enron dataset
- Budget PCST
  - Two more papers
  - Is the Moss paper really not useful
    - is ellipsoid algorithmhard?
	- what is the packing algorithm?
	- is it fast?
- Quota version makes sense: minimize topic difference while ensuring influence/message-count constraint is fulfilled.
  - Find more work on that
  - If we use quota version, should Problem 3 change?
- Quota version experiment:
  - Find/implement k-mst/quota problem
  - run it with the modified problem 3

If possible:

- Check/implement the other ideas in `2015-han/related-work.md`
