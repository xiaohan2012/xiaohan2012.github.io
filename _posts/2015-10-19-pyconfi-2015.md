# Introduction

I participated the [PyCon Finland, 2015](http://fi.pycon.org/2015/). Quite cool experience for me as I got to know a lot of new technologies and cool and interesting people.

This post is all about information/resource sharing.

For more information about the talks, please refer to the [official site](http://fi.pycon.org/2015/).

# Stuff learned

## Testing tools

Besides `nose` and `unittest`, here are a list of testing tools I got to know:

Very interesting topics/libs:

- [hypothesis](https://github.com/DRMacIver/hypothesis): testing against much larger range of examples
- [factoryboy](https://factoryboy.readthedocs.org/en/latest/): realistic random values generated using [fake-factory](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/fake-factory)
- [Testing flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/0.10/testing/): some boilerplate code to test flask
- [pytest](http://pytest.org/latest/index.html): works with nose, unittest style tests etc. The failure report seems to be more readable. Quite a lot of terminology going on there.
- [mock](https://github.com/testing-cabal/mock): a way to create "mock" objects.
- Stress/scalability testing in Python.

Less interesting libs:

- [Django test](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.8/topics/testing/overview/): not sure if it's general enough for other Web frameworks
- [Tox](https://tox.readthedocs.org/en/latest/): cross-flatform and cross-Python testing


## Async Python

In Python 3.5, async programming is supported in a easier-to-use-and-read way.

Important library:

- [asyncio](https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio.html):  infrastructure for writing single-threaded concurrent code


And a list of [related async libraries](https://github.com/aio-libs), for

- Database: MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, SQLAlchemy, Redis
- HTTP: http client/server for asyncio
- Templating: jinja2 for example
- Elastic Search
- And more

## Other tools

### Smaller tools

- [gunicorn](http://gunicorn.org/): run several servers at a time. Can be used with Nginx.
- [ujson](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/ujson): ultra fast json
- [sqlalchemy](http://www.sqlalchemy.org/): ORM and [one tutorial](https://speakerdeck.com/zzzeek/introduction-to-sqlalchemy-pycon-2013)
- [ZMQ](http://zeromq.org/): very lightweight. Higher learning curve I guess. Implements **AMQP**. A related [stackoverflow post](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/731233/activemq-or-rabbitmq-or-zeromq-or) comparing various tools
- [RabbitMQ](https://www.rabbitmq.com/): all about messaging. It gives your applications a common platform to send and receive messages, and your messages a safe place to live until received. Supports quite a lot of languages. **AMQP** is one of the protocols supported by RabbitMQ.
- [asphalt](https://github.com/asphalt-framework): similar to twisted. Quite new for now.

### Bigger tools

- [docker](https://www.docker.com/):
  - some new virtualization technology that is more efficient than virtual machine. A good [image](http://www.zdnet.com/article/what-is-docker-and-why-is-it-so-darn-popular/) illustrating this.
  - easier to ship and package programs(via the *Docker Hub*?)
  - When do I need it
- [Kafka](http://kafka.apache.org/):  publish-subscribe messaging, stream processing. Can I use it to build a Facebook or Wechat feed? How is *log* stuff? [A Practical Guide to Building a Stream Data Platform](http://www.confluent.io/blog/stream-data-platform-1/)
- [Elastic Search]():
  - real-time search/analytics
  - distributed/high-availability
  - built on top of Luceneâ„¢
  - [elasticsearch-dsl](http://elasticsearch-dsl.readthedocs.org/en/latest/) for Python


## Code as a crime scene(bug prediction)

Cool stuff:

- Book: [Your Code as a Crime Scene](https://pragprog.com/book/atcrime/your-code-as-a-crime-scene)
- Conference: [Mining Software Repositories](http://2015.msrconf.org/)
- Visualizing repository:
  - [CodeCity](http://www.inf.usi.ch/phd/wettel/codecity.html)
  - [Class hierarchy](http://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/4063530)
  - Presented in the talk: bug count in Django for each module(adapted from the above example)
  - Extension: different metrics for each module, like # of committers, # of line add/delete. Visualizing how code executes or how bugs propagate?
- Interesting questions
  - How are bugs correlated?
  - How to predict bugs?
  - More general: are there any interesting patterns for bugs?

# Summary

Important things for me:

- Async programming in Python 3.5: should I switch to Python 3?
- Python testing tools such as pytest, factoryboy and hypothesis.
- "Bigger" tool such as Kafka, Elastic Search and Docker.
- Cool tools: gunicorn, sqlalchemy, ujson, RabbitMQ, etc.
- Interesting research question: mining code repository and bug prediction/mining.
