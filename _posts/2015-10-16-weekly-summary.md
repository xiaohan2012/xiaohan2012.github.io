# Done & learned

- Two formal [problem definition](/crafting/2015/10/12/dynamic-graph-summary-problem-definition/) written, including label-based and topic-model-based formulation. Discucsed with Aris and Polina. Learned that
  - Make a slide next time not an article.
  - The max edge coverage approach imposes density as well. 
  - The conclusion on density approach drawback from the "hagnout" example is wrong.
  - Incorporating vertex weight(PageRank to get) by inversing it or calculating the edge weight by avarage the its nodes' weights
- Read more on the [Enron dataset](/dataset/2015/10/15/enron-dataset/)
- Found some interesting datasets. For example the Bloomberg entity graph or Q&A site graph.

# Todo

- Formulate an algorithm for the topic-modeling based approach
- Apply topic modeling on the Enron dataset
- Crawling the Bloomberg dataset
- Discuss with Aris and Polina
