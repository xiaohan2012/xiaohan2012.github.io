# Done

- Wrote the majority of the documentation
- Came up with a dynamic programming algorithm for *maximum weighted independent set of size K* 
- Later rejected by Aris as it's not optimal
- Skimmed through some papers on PCST and found the big area of combinatorial optimization


# To-do

- Notations consistensy, illustrative features
- Formulation of maximum set cover problem as finding k best subtrees
- Finish the documentation
- Read something on Primal-Dual formulation for combinatorial optimization
